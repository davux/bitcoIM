# Dependencies

This program requires the following Python modules to work:
  - xmpppy: http://xmpppy.sourceforge.net/
  - bitcoin: http://gitorious.org/python-bitcoin/


# Configuration

Edit 'bitcoim.conf.example' and rename it to '/etc/bitcoim/bitcoim.conf'.

In the [XMPP] section, set up the credentials that should be used to connect
as a component to the Jabber server.

The [database] section is used to set up the file name of the SQLite database
that the program stores its persistent data in (registrations, bitcoin
addresses, users' balances, etc.). The user running the program must have
write access to whatever file name you write in there.

The [bitcoin] section is used for connecting to the bitcoin client (bitcoind
or bitcoin -server).
