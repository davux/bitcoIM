# Dependencies

This program requires the following Python modules to work:
  - xmpppy: http://xmpppy.sourceforge.net/
  - bitcoin: http://gitorious.org/python-bitcoin/

It also needs access to a running instance of the bitcoin software
(version 0.3.17 or later), in server mode (bitcoind or bitcoin -server).
The bitcoin software may run on the same host or on a different one
(see "Configuration" for more details).


# Configuration

Edit 'bitcoim.conf.example' and rename it to '/etc/bitcoim/bitcoim.conf'.

In the [XMPP] section, set up the credentials that should be used to connect
as a component to the Jabber server.

The [database] section is used to set up the file name of the SQLite database
that the program stores its persistent data in (registrations, bitcoin
addresses, users' balances, etc.). The user running the program must have
write access to whatever file name you write in there.

The [bitcoin] section is used for connecting to the bitcoin client (bitcoind
or bitcoin -server). You must at least specify a user and a password.
Optional parameters are 'host' (defaults to localhost), 'port' (defaults
to 8332) and 'protocol' (http or https, defaults to http).

The [main program] section handles the behaviour of the program itself.
The most important option of this section is "admins". Set it to a
space-separated list of the admins' JID.
The "loglevel" option controls the verbosity of the program. Set it to any
of these values:
 - 'debug': prints all sorts of debugging information about what is going on.
 - 'info': prints possibly interesting information for a system/service
           administration purposes.
 - 'warning': when something abnormal but not grave is happening. Generally,
              the program is able to deal with the situation, but the fact
              that it happened might hide something.
 - 'error': something is going wrong. You probably want to know about it.
 - 'critical': the program can't continue its execution. By the time you get
               to read the message, it's probably already stopped.

Any message less important than the value you set won't be printed.
If you don't set a loglevel, or if you set it wrong, 'info' is assumed.
